UMKarts
=======

A repository of code for the control of rc cars that can play Mario Kart.

Steps to get it running after a clone
1) Open up the gc libero project
2) Generate Components!! This is important. Laser Tag will not work without this
3) Program the device
4) Write Application Code
5) When you are asked for your workspace, switch it to (gc\SoftConsole\gc_MSS_MSS_CM3_0\)
6) Import the projects (I don't know why you have to do this, its annoying)
	Goto File->Import
	Under General select Existing Projects into Workspace
	Under Browse goto gc\SoftConsole\gc_MSS_MSS_CM3_0
	Select all and click Finish
	* Note: You should be able to just say Browse->Ok->Finish
7) The first time you'll have to setup your Debug Configuration
