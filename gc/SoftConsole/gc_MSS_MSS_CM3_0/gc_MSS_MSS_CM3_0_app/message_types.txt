APPLICATION LEVEL MESSAGE TYPES

This files contains information of the different message types that we 
currently support being sent in our system. There are currently very few, but 
we may extend them later in the future so don't try to optimize for the few 
that are available right now.

0x00 - PRINTF
This message type is really only used with the listener. We use it to send data 
to the listner that can that be printed for debugging purposes. The payload of 
this message is just a string. We do not support longer strings than can fit in 
one message (although we may support that in the future)

0x01 - PRINTF_EXTENDED
Reserved for allowing us to print longer strings than one packet sized

0x02 - GAME_HOST
This message type contains no payload, and announces to the world that we are 
hosting a game. All cars default into a game hosting state. If two cars in the 
same area are both trying to host a game, the car with the lower XBee address 
wins as host and the other must become a client.
This message is special because it is the only message in the entire game that 
is sent in broadcast mode. This is because we want to give all XBee's a chance 
to respond.

0x03 - GAME_JOIN
This message allows us to ask the host if we may join there game. Upon 
receiving an ACK for this packet, we know that we are actually in the game!

0x04 - GAME_START
This message is sent out from the host to signify that we are starting a new 
game. It contains a payload of the following:
[uint8_t num_players][uint64_t address0][uint64_t address1].....
Upon receiving this packet, we may start playing the game. Only the game host 
can send this packet, no one else.

0x05 - GAME_OVER
This message tells the receiver that the game is over. As soons as this is the 
receiver should go into a "game_over" state. The only way back into a 
"new_game" state is to hold down the start button.

0x06 - SEND_MESSAGE
This is our default "in game" message. It communicates events that happen. By 
default we send our messages to everyone, though we could probably get away 
with just sending events to the listener.

0x80 - ACK
This is our ACK message. We send it, when a packet asks for an ACK, containing 
the following payload:
[uint8_t frame_id_of_acked_packet][uint8_t message_type_of_acked_packet]
